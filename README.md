# Particle Galaxy with Shaders


This project demonstrates a particle system using shaders to create a dynamic galaxy of stars. The primary goal is to animate particles efficiently by leveraging GPU capabilities through vertex shaders. Unlike traditional methods that animate each vertex directly in the geometry, shaders allow for direct manipulation of vertices, improving performance significantly.
