# Particle Galaxy with Shaders


This project demonstrates a particle system using shaders to create a dynamic galaxy of stars. The primary goal is to animate particles efficiently by leveraging GPU capabilities through vertex shaders.

## Features

- Stars in the galaxy rotate at varying speeds based on their distance from the center.
- Utilizes vertex shaders to animate particles and draw intricate patterns, enhancing visual appeal.
- GPU-driven animation for efficient rendering of particle movements.
- Easy to modify shaders and particle properties to create different visual effects

## Installation

- Run npm install to install dependencies
- Run npm run dev to launch the local server
